Package: test.tidync
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Title: Tests for 'tidync'
Description: Testing the tidync package is quite onerous without having a lot
 of NetCDF files on hand. This package exists to pull out a lot of local-specific
 tests built into tidync that could assume the use of 'raadtools' and 'bowerbird' for
 availability of files.
